# ChoreDoor

It's a single-page website that plays a little fully-functional game. A little example of how HTML, CSS and JS interact harmoniously to produce a dynamic website. Made with the help of a project walkthrough video from codeacademy with the sole purpose of learning.

## Project Structure

The various files are:

  * index.html -- contains all the front end body
  * style.css -- contains all the CSS code used for styling
  * script.js -- contains the main dynamic part of site
  
 ## what is the game?
  * Hiding behind one of the three doors shown is the ChoreBot.

  * Your mission is to open all of the doors without running into the ChoreBot.

  * If you manage to avoid the ChoreBot until the very last door, you win!
